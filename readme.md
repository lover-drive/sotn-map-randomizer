This is a proof-of-concept of a Symphony of the Night map randomizer.

# How to run
1. Add `map_recorder.lua` and `map_randomizer.lua` to Lua Console in Bizhawk.
2. Run `map_recorder.lua`. If everything works correctly, you'll see flashing REC indicator in the corner of your screen.
3. Beat the game. All rooms you have visited will be added into pool for the randomizer to use.
4. Run `map_randomizer.lua` and enjoy!

# Known issues
**DO NOT ENTER DOORS AS WOLF. YOU WILL GET STUCK.** Bat is fine, though.

Sometimes your weapon stops working. In that case, open and reclose inventory, and it should be fine.
